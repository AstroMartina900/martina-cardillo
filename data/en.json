    "intro": "Roman astrophysicist, I am a researcher at the <a href=\"https://www.iaps.inaf.it/it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Institute of Astrophysics and Space Planetology (IAPS)</strong></a> in Rome, one of the branches of the <a href=\"http://www.inaf.it/it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF)</strong></a>.<br>I focus on the acceleration of <strong>cosmic rays</strong> from galactic sources through <strong>gamma-ray astrophysics</strong>, which studies the most energetic events in the Universe. My work ranges from the <strong>instrument-signal interface</strong> in space to the <strong>analysis and interpretation of data</strong>. I am involved in several national and international collaborations, in particular I am part of the <a href=\"https://agile.ssdc.asi.it/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>AGILE</strong></a> team (Italian gamma-ray satellite) and the <a href=\"https://www.astri.inaf.it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>ASTRI</strong></a> Mini-Array project (future network of gamma-ray telescopes).<br>I love to <a href=\"pages/didattica-divulgazione.html\"><strong>tell science stories</strong></a> and the Universe in particular, and I do it whenever I can, both through institutional channels (e.g. <a href=\"https://storie.inaf.it/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Gruppo Storie INAF</strong></a>) and personal channels (YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/piuspaziopertutti\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Pi\u00f9 Spazio Per Tutti</strong></a>, Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RomaCaputAstri\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Roma Caput Astri</strong></a>).<br>I love art in all its forms, Rome, and I am hyperactive, the kind that needs to be calmed down sometimes.",
